Three must ask questions:
1. What [version control system / unit testing tool / framework] do you use?
2. What did you compare it to?
3. How did you select it?

Why?
Version control system: do not hire someone who is not keeping track of different version of their programs
Unit testing tool: do not hire a developer who is not testing parts of their code
Framework: it it highly unlikely that you are interviewing one of the few hundred developers in the world who are so good they do not need frameworks. If you do come across one of these individuals, do not waste their talents on building frameworks!
