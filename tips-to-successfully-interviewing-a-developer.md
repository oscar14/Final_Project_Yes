Three must ask questions:

1. What [version control system / unit testing tool / framework] do you use?
2. What did you compare it to?
3. How did you select it?

Why?
   *Version control system: do not hire someone who is not keeping track of different version of their programs
   *Unit testing tool: do not hire a developer who is not testing parts of their code
   *Framework: it it highly unlikely that you are interviewing one of the few hundred developers in the world who are so good they do not need frameworks. If you do come across one of these individuals, do not waste their talents on building frameworks!

Other qualities to look for:
Curiosity
Developers who present possible options rather than say something cannot be done 
Someone who can understand the user perspective
Someone who is organized in their manner of thinking: who writes code that writes code; who does not duplicate code within the same program; who designs for and exploits concurrency.

Final thoughts:
Approach developers by appealing to their curiosity. The best people to have on your team are the ones who are passionate about the cause! 
The best developers do not work with agencies
Skimping on a hourly salary results in a more expensive project. A good rule of thumb for direct cost is $125/hr.
