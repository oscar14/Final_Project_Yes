Our class discussion around the Lean Startup approach left us with some very practical tools and a mindset for evaluating new business concepts and conveying a sense of urgency to our diligence in evaluating the business.

Given the high and convex nature of dollars spend programming applications, the Lean Startup mindset teaches us to “fail fast” by focusing on minimum viable products, or MVPs, that we can bring to market with minimal upfront cost as a means to seek customer feedback, learn product/service strengths and weaknesses, and to hopefully make a decision on whether or not to proceed with the business idea in full.  Many dollars have been wasted by entrepreneurs and managers who insist on their product’s viability and rush into the application design and build stages- employing “big design upfront”- only to see their businesses bleed money and ultimately fail due to lack of product-market fit.  Simple lean planning and testing could have informed these managers of these gaps and potentially rerouted the businesses away from downfall.  

Concierge MVP prototypes provide potential customers with the impression of what the product or service may look like at little investment cost, while offering useful information from the customer’s perspective.  A prototype’s ability to iterate and ultimately, squarely face the problem space will ultimately point the way towards potential success for the business.
