KANBAN Analysis
I really enjoyed learning systematic ways to management software projects in class, including SCRUM and KANBAN. 
The KANBAN system offers lots of advantages in terms of managing complex work flows. Instead of setting multiple goals/objectives and allow developers to tackle them together, KANBAN system allows for more clarity, prioritization and flexibility. The system in general organize tasks into “To Do”, “Design”, “Development” and “Done” and other more detailed categories. It allow the software engineers to focus on one or a few tasks at one time and accomplish frequent accomplishments throughout the process. It also allow the project manager to better understand the work load that each software engineer is dealing with and frequently shift responsibilities. It provides a lot of flexibility and helps to prevent last minute bad work. Essentially, this methodology cut one big project into small pieces and facilitate the completion of each piece effectively. 
I really like the KANBAN concept because it can be applied to other corporate/manufacture operations and even help financial budgeting team to gain insights. For example, I worked on a financial reporting team that required a combined effort of 20 financial analyst to drive a portion of the reporting work and merge the results together at the end. KANBAN analysis and daily standup was a great way to monitor progress through the reporting season. Another example, when managing large budget of IT projects, dividing large projects to smaller ones will allow more accurate financial forecast.
