Hi Team! Let's decide the focus of our final project--

1. Does anyone have a "live enterprise" that they would like to test on?
2. Any passion topics?
3. If not, I love pets and would enjoy making basic elements of a website to set cat food and supplies online.  :)

Please reply with your great ideas.  Project directions below.

Best,
Kristen

 Managing Software Development Group Assignment

    Submitting a website url

As a team “build” a piece of software using GitHub, collaborating using feature branches, pull requests, local and online commits, code reviews and issues. It’s a group based assignment and while it doesn’t require the group to meet in person, you should at least schedule a time to interact - either in person or online.

Once you have completed the assignment, please post a final link to your pull request in Canvas.

All other instructions are in the repo:
