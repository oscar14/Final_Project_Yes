What I learned about people management by reading Pragmatic Programmer (PP)

During “Digital Literacy” class, and while reading PP, I was repeatedly struck by how I could take coding and supervising software development as a metaphor for working and supervising people.  I have found this metaphor to powerfully remove the subjectivity from several core aspects of being a good employee and a good manager.  As a student of management, business, and almost all disciplines of human knowledge, this has been a rewarding discovery.  Here are some specific insights I have acquired.

To be a good manager of people
•	Provide vision
•	Provide structure
•	Let the doers decide the method of getting the work done
•	Ask questions, both to help move things forward and to ensure quality

On being a good “worker” / Coding is similar in deep ways to being a knowledge worker or an artisan.  
•	Individual workers have their own profiles of strengths and weaknesses, preferences and dislikes
•	Good workers learn new things and integrate the new knowledge and insights with their prior knowledge, so that they can do things in new and better ways.  They experience “pleasure in a feeling of continuous improvement”
•	Think about what you are doing and why.  Don’t fall into hazy-brain states while you are working.  [Deep mindfulness (“flow”) is good; learn to recognize the difference in your own mental states]

Both as a worker and a manager:
•	Don’t be afraid to ask sufficient questions to get to clarity.  Don’t let doubts and uncertainties linger.  When you get a response, follow up and push deeper with additional questions as needed.  Don’t be worried about whether someone things you are dumb.  [Because, really, who’s smart: the one who realizes what they don’t know and surmounts that limitation, or the one who doesn’t think critically and misses something important]
